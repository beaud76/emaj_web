Emaj_web Installation Guide
-----------------------------

1. Unpack your download

   If you've downloaded a tar.gz package, execute from a terminal:

   gunzip Emaj_web-*.tar.gz
   tar -xvf Emaj_web-*.tar

   Else, if you've downloaded a tar.bz2 package, execute from a terminal: 

   bunzip2 Emaj_web-*.tar.bz2
   tar -xvf Emaj_web-*.tar

   Else, if you've downloaded a zip package, execute from a terminal:

   unzip Emaj_web-*.zip

2. Configure Emaj_web

   edit Emaj_web/conf/config.inc.php

   If you mess up the configuration file, you can recover it from the
   config.inc.php-dist file.

3. If you run your PHP installation in safe mode, in order that the database
   dump feature can work correctly, you need to set the 'safe_mode_allowed_env_vars'
   php.ini variable to include the PGPASSWORD and PGUSER environmental variables
   and the safe_mode_exec_dir to include /usr/bin (or wherever the pg_dump
   binaries are found).
   
   	eg. safe_mode_allowed_env_vars = PHP_,PG
   	    safe_mode_exec_dir = /usr/bin
   
   Given that you usually don't want to allow everything in /usr/bin to
   be executed, you might want to copy the pg_dump and pg_dumpall utilities
   to a directory by themselves.
   
   Lastly, if you run Emaj_web in safe mode, very long running imports,
   exports and transactions may time out and be aborted.

4. Browse to the Emaj_web installation using a web browser.

5. IMPORTANT - SECURITY

   PostgreSQL by default does not require you to use a password to log in.
   We STRONGLY recommend that you enable md5 passwords for local connections
   in your pg_hba.conf, and set a password for the default superuser account.

   In order to prevent risky connections, there is a configuration file
   option called 'extra_login_security', which is TRUE by default. While
   this option is enabled, you will be unable to log in to Emaj_web as
   the 'root', 'administrator', 'pgsql' or 'postgres' users and empty passwords
   will not work.
   
   Once you are certain you have properly secured your database server, you
   can then disable 'extra_login_security' so that you can log in as your
   database administrator using the administrator password.
