2- Objectives

Emaj_web is a php web client that interfaces the E-Maj PostgreSQL extension (available on https://github.com/beaud76/emaj).

The main goals of E-Maj are:
	- log updates performed on one or several sets of tables.
	- cancel these updates if needed, and reset a tables set to a predefined stable state.

The client allows users to easily look at the tables groups state and perform all E-Maj operations.

A plugin for phpPgAdmin exists, with the same features. But this application is a stand alone client.
It has actualy borrowed a lot of code from phpPgAdmin.


3- Documentation

The E-Maj documentation can be found at http://emaj.readthedocs.io (in English and in French).
A page describes the use of the phpPgAdmin plugin. It is also relevant for Emaj_web.


4- Installation

Please look at the INSTALL file.


5- Support

For additional support or bug report, please contact Philippe BEAUDOIN (phb <dot> emaj <at> free <dot> fr) or create an issue on this github project.

Any feedback is welcome, even to just notice you use E-Maj and Emaj_web ;-)
