About the phpPgAdmin E-Maj Plugin
----------------------------------

The E-Maj plugin is the web GUI for the E-Maj PostgreSQL extension. 

The E-Maj extension enables you to log all updates performed on set of 
tables, named "tables groups". This recorded information can be used to 
either audit these updates or cancel them in "rollback" operations. "Marks" 
are explicitely defined points in time that are used for "rollbacks".

With the E-Maj extension, all actions are performed through SQL functions. 
Using this plugin, the same actions can be easily executed through the 
phpPgAdmin interface.

The PostgreSQL E-Maj extension can be donwloaded either from PGXN.org or 
from pgfoundry.org.
